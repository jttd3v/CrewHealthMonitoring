# Crew Health Monitoring

This repository contains HTML tools for collecting and analyzing crew health metrics.

## Contents
- `office_chm_v1` - KPI dashboard that loads crew data from XML files and renders charts.
- `ship_chm_v6` - Monthly report form with options to export data to PDF or print the report.
- `html2pdf.bundle.min.js` - JavaScript library used for PDF export.

Open the HTML files directly in a browser to use them. The dashboard expects XML files generated by the ship report.
